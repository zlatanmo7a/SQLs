-- so its notice that there is significant deffrent between befor and after numbers
its 1 before the pandamic and 19 after and 0 at 2019 maybe its belongs to the fear and
shoke that happened to all the worled at that time and then things starts to get better
cuase the world starts to know more about the virus (of cource all of that according to 
this dataset and egnoring the hikes that netflix went through cause as sayed its about just htis info
