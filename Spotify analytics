--here am trying to ask and answer questions about this spotify schema 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (

select * from spotifydata limit 3;

--doing sum aggrations 

select avg(energy) as avgEnergy,
       min (energy) as minEnergy,
       max(energy) as max ,
       artist_name

from spotifydata
;

--sort the singers by te enegy of their songes 


select avg(energy) Energy,artist_name
 from spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by Energy desc;

--top 10 popular artists

select artist_name,sum(popularity) popularity
from spotifydata 
group by artist_name
order by popularity desc
limit 10;


--q:what is the songs that probably gonna be played in the high class & romantic places?
-- we need to look at bottum 5 loudness

select avg(loudness) as avg,
       min(loudness) as min,
       max(loudness) as max
from spotifydata ;

--avg ~ -6  
--min ~ -12 quite
--max ~ -3  loud


select track_name,loudness from spotifydata
where loudness <-6 limit 5



;
-- sort the songs by loudness level 

select track_name,
case when loudness between -7 and -4 then 'normal'
     when loudness < -7 then 'loud'
     else 'quite'
     end as loudness_lvl
     from spotifydata
     ;
     

     --possible Imaginary scenario--
--we(spotify) want to run a sparkling drink ads
--- what is the places and audince should be targeted? 
-- young ppl places clubs,parties 
--- so i think probably we targeting loud music and then normal 
 
select  track_name,loudness from spotifydata 
where loudness > -6
order by loudness desc
;

--thank u
